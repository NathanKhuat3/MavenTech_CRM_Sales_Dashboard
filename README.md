PROJECT BACKGROUND

Maven Tech is a company that specializes in selling computer hardware to large businesses. They've been using a new CRM system to track their sales opportunities but have no visibility of the data outside of the platform. As a BI Developer in the company, I am working with the Sales Managers to create an interactive dashboard that allow them to track their team's quarterly performance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The sales data highlights strong seasonality, with Q2 driving the highest revenue while Q1 generate substantially less revenue than other quarters. Despite having the highest average close value per transaction and the highest conversion rate, the low number of closed accounts and the long average turnaround time per transaction means that the First Quarter was unable to yield significant revenue. In terms of product, GTX Basic has the highest number of transactions but GTX Plus Pro and MG Advanced are more important for revenue. 

INSIGHTS DETAILS

Revenue:
- On average, the other three quarters more than double the revenue of the First Quarter, with the Second Quarter being the highest revenue generating quarter, indicating strong seasonality. 
- The average close value per closed transaction is roughly $1,300 for Quarter 1 but only $1,100 for the remaining 3 quarters

Turn Around Time
- The average Turnaround Time for a transaction is 1.6 months
- On average, the first quarter takes about 2.2 months to close a transaction but the remaining quarters only take 1.5 months. However the first quarter witness a significantly higher Won/Lost ratio in deals
- Out of 8800 transactions recorded, 5564 accounts (63%) were Closed and 3236 accounts (37%) were either in the Engaging phase or Prospecting Phase
- Other quarters close roughly 3 times the number of accounts closed in the First Quarter, once again suggesting seasonality effect. 

Product
- The product with the highest number of transactions is GTX Basic and this is true for all quarters and all teams. GTX Basic is the Flag Ship Product
- Despite GTX Basic being the most popular product, the GTX Plus Pro and MG Advanced were the main revenue contributors across all quarters, together accounting for more than 70% of the year's total revenue


RECOMMENDATION

- Review and ensure that GTX Basic's pricing is optimized as there is high demand for this product
- Provide quarterly and annual bonuses to employees as a fraction of their generated sales 
- Assign high performing employees to big-revenue client deals, ensure high level of quality check and customer service for important customers
- Identify medium-sized clients and target them with customized offerings and loyalty programs to encourage repurchase
- Utilize the off-season in the First Quarter to focus on formulating sales strategy, restocking inventory and providing training. This time of low demand can also be used for identifying leads and laying the groundwork for relationships without the immediate goal of a sale.
